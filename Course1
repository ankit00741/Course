Name: Ankit Uikey
Module: Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique / method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems, the results are saved and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution. It avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.
